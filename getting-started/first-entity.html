title: Making your first Entity
---

A Crafty.js game is build up by entities, that would be eg. your hero and the enemies. 

This is the simplest entity you can create which shows up on the game.
{% highlight javascript %}
Crafty.e('2D, DOM, Color').attr({x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100}).color('#F00');
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see a string is passed to the e() function, these are the Crafty.js Components that entity would have avaiable. You can think of it a building blocks. Here we have said that our entity has the building block Color, but also the 2D components, which makes it possible to place it in the game.

You will learn more about Components later on.

The full code would look something like this now:

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <div id="game"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://rawgithub.com/craftyjs/Crafty/release/dist/crafty-min.js"></script>
    <script>
      Crafty.init(500,350, document.getElementById('game'));
      Crafty.e('2D, DOM, Color').attr({x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100}).color('#F00');
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

And when executed:
